				Welcome to <b>Piano Hobby</b> by<br>Hailey Chan - offering fun private piano lessons for all ages in Vancouver. 
			</div>
			<div class="content" id="contentabout"><div id="profile"></div>
Hailey Dione Chan has been a piano and music theory teacher for over 15 years.  Born and raised in Vancouver, B.C., she is fluent in English and Cantonese. At the age of 5, she started playing piano and by age 15 she began instructing part-time.  Her qualifications include the completion of all the Royal Conservatory of Music exams, the study of piano pedagogy, and being certified with an ARCT Teacher’s diploma. <i>[The Associate of The Royal Conservatory (ARCT) diploma is the highest academic standings awarded by The Royal Conservatory. The ARCT Teacher's diploma is respected internationally as a teaching qualification.]</i> <br>
  <br>
 Hailey always had the passion to share her love for music with others. Through her classes, she strives to make the learning process both creative and enjoyable for her students. Her lessons are tailored to suit the specific needs and goals of the individual student - from those actively entering music exams and festivals, to others that simply treat piano playing as a hobby.  Her students come from all ages, ranging from the young age of 3 to 30+. <br>
<br>
This fun and patient instructor strongly believes that it is never too late to learn playing the piano!  For pleasure, Hailey improvises songs and plays by ear (click on <a href="#" id="vidlink">VIDEOS</a> for samples).

<b>Frequently Asked Questions</b>
<br><br>
<b>Why learn the piano?</b><br>
Learning the piano helps improve self-expression and creativity. It also helps facilitate development of life-long skills such as concentration, coordination, self-confidence, discipline, communication, patience, perseverance, and relaxation. Most importantly, learning the piano is fun and rewarding! 
<br><br>
<b>What’s the best age to start learning piano?</b><br>
It is never too late to learn but it may be too early for some children.  I’ve taught students starting at 3.5 years old but it really depends on each child’s learning ability, personality and level of discipline and focus. 
<br><br>
<b>What kind of piano do you teach with?</b><br>
I teach with a Boston grand piano even to beginners. The advantages of playing on a grand piano include better sound, touch and quality. Students tend to feel more comfortable performing on stage and at exams when exposed to a grand piano at an early age. 
<br><br>
<b>There are other teachers with an ARCT Performers diploma. How is that diploma different from your Teacher’s diploma?</b><br>
A good performer does not mean he/she is a good teacher nor has the patience and ability to explain clear instructions to students.
<br><br>
<b>I’m interested in piano lessons. Do I need a piano or can I use a keyboard?</b><br>
An upright piano is the most popular and the best choice in the long-term.  Not only is it a good investment, it plays and sounds better. If you’re uncertain about making the commitment to a piano, you can certainly start with a digital piano or a keyboard. However, the keyboard’s action is very light and it becomes very difficult for students to develop the finger strength and control that is required for proper piano technique.
<br><br>
<b>How long do my lessons have to be?</b><br>
Depending on your age and level, they can be half an hour, 45 minutes or an hour. 
<br><br>
<b>Do I have to sign a contract?</b><br>
No, your payment at the beginning of each month ensures your lesson time slot for that month. There is no registration fee either.
<br><br>
<b>How much do you charge?</b><br>
